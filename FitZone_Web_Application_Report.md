    INDEX idx_trainer_date (trainer_id, appointment_date)
);
```

### 4.2 Backend Technology Implementation

#### 4.2.1 PHP Architecture

**Object-Oriented Design:** Implemented clean PHP architecture with separation of concerns:

**Database Singleton Pattern:**
```php
class Database {
    private static $instance = null;
    private $connection;
    
    public static function getInstance() {
        if (self::$instance === null) {
            self::$instance = new self();
        }
        return self::$instance;
    }
    
    public function getConnection() {
        return $this->connection;
    }
    
    public function select($query, $params = []) {
        $stmt = $this->connection->prepare($query);
        $stmt->execute($params);
        return $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
    }
}
```

**User Management Class:**
```php
class UserManager {
    private $db;
    
    public function __construct() {
        $this->db = getDB();
    }
    
    public function createUser($userData, $adminId = null) {
        try {
            $this->db->getConnection()->beginTransaction();
            
            // Create user record
            $userId = $this->db->insert('users', [
                'first_name' => $userData['first_name'],
                'last_name' => $userData['last_name'],
                'email' => $userData['email'],
                'phone' => $userData['phone'],
                'role' => $userData['role'],
                'password_hash' => password_hash($userData['password'], PASSWORD_BCRYPT)
            ]);
            
            // Create user profile
            $this->db->insert('user_profiles', [
                'user_id' => $userId,
                'date_of_birth' => $userData['date_of_birth'],
                'gender' => $userData['gender'],
                'emergency_contact' => $userData['emergency_contact']
            ]);
            
            $this->db->getConnection()->commit();
            return $userId;
        } catch (Exception $e) {
            $this->db->getConnection()->rollBack();
            throw $e;
        }
    }
}
```

#### 4.2.2 Security Implementation

**Authentication System:** Implemented comprehensive authentication with session management:

```php
function loginUser($email, $password, $rememberMe = false) {
    $db = getDB();
    
    // Rate limiting check
    if (!checkRateLimit('login', 5, 900)) {
        return ['success' => false, 'message' => 'Too many login attempts'];
    }
    
    $user = $db->selectOne(
        "SELECT id, email, password_hash, role, status FROM users WHERE email = ?",
        [$email]
    );
    
    if ($user && password_verify($password, $user['password_hash'])) {
        if ($user['status'] !== 'active') {
            return ['success' => false, 'message' => 'Account is not active'];
        }
        
        // Create session
        session_regenerate_id(true);
        $_SESSION['user_id'] = $user['id'];
        $_SESSION['user_role'] = $user['role'];
        $_SESSION['logged_in'] = true;
        
        // Handle remember me functionality
        if ($rememberMe) {
            $token = bin2hex(random_bytes(32));
            $hashedToken = hash('sha256', $token);
            
            $db->insert('remember_tokens', [
                'user_id' => $user['id'],
                'token_hash' => $hashedToken,
                'expires_at' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s', time() + (30 * 24 * 60 * 60))
            ]);
            
            setcookie('remember_token', $token, time() + (30 * 24 * 60 * 60), '/', '', true, true);
        }
        
        logActivity($user['id'], 'login', 'User logged in successfully');
        return ['success' => true, 'redirect' => 'unified-dashboard.html'];
    }
    
    return ['success' => false, 'message' => 'Invalid credentials'];
}
```

**CSRF Protection:** Implemented token-based CSRF protection:

```php
function generateCSRFToken() {
    if (!isset($_SESSION['csrf_token'])) {
        $_SESSION['csrf_token'] = bin2hex(random_bytes(32));
    }
    return $_SESSION['csrf_token'];
}

function verifyCSRFToken($token) {
    return isset($_SESSION['csrf_token']) && hash_equals($_SESSION['csrf_token'], $token);
}
```

#### 4.2.3 Booking System Implementation

**Conflict Detection:** Developed sophisticated booking conflict detection:

```php
function checkSchedulingConflicts($trainerId, $userId, $appointmentDate, $startTime, $endTime) {
    $db = getDB();
    
    // Check trainer conflicts
    $trainerConflict = $db->selectOne(
        "SELECT id FROM pt_appointments 
         WHERE trainer_id = ? AND appointment_date = ? 
         AND status NOT IN ('cancelled', 'completed')
         AND ((start_time <= ? AND end_time > ?) OR 
              (start_time < ? AND end_time >= ?) OR 
              (start_time >= ? AND end_time <= ?))",
        [$trainerId, $appointmentDate, $startTime, $startTime, $endTime, $endTime, $startTime, $endTime]
    );
    
    if ($trainerConflict) {
        return [
            'hasConflict' => true,
            'message' => 'Trainer already has an appointment during this time slot'
        ];
    }
    
    // Check user conflicts with existing appointments and class bookings
    // ... additional conflict checking logic
    
    return ['hasConflict' => false, 'message' => ''];
}
```

**Dynamic Pricing Calculation:**
```php
function calculateTrainingPrice($trainer, $appointmentType, $durationMinutes, $membershipPlan) {
    $baseHourlyRate = $trainer['hourly_rate'] ?? 75.00;
    $hours = $durationMinutes / 60;
    
    // Apply appointment type multipliers
    $typeMultipliers = [
        'individual' => 1.0,
        'small_group' => 0.7,
        'assessment' => 1.2,
        'consultation' => 0.8
    ];
    
    // Apply membership discounts
    $membershipDiscounts = [
        'basic' => 0.0,
        'premium' => 0.10,
        'elite' => 0.20
    ];
    
    $typeMultiplier = $typeMultipliers[$appointmentType] ?? 1.0;
    $discount = $membershipDiscounts[$membershipPlan] ?? 0.0;
    
    $basePrice = $baseHourlyRate * $hours * $typeMultiplier;
    $finalPrice = $basePrice * (1 - $discount);
    
    return round($finalPrice, 2);
}
```

### 4.3 Error Handling and Validation

#### 4.3.1 Comprehensive Error Handling

**Exception Management:** Implemented structured error handling throughout the application:

```php
function errorResponse($message, $errors = [], $statusCode = 400) {
    http_response_code($statusCode);
    header('Content-Type: application/json');
    
    $response = [
        'success' => false,
        'message' => $message,
        'errors' => $errors,
        'timestamp' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s')
    ];
    
    // Log error for debugging
    logError($message, [
        'errors' => $errors,
        'status_code' => $statusCode,
        'request_uri' => $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] ?? 'unknown',
        'user_id' => $_SESSION['user_id'] ?? null
    ]);
    
    echo json_encode($response);
    exit;
}
```

**Input Validation:** Developed comprehensive validation functions:

```php
function validatePassword($password) {
    $errors = [];
    
    if (strlen($password) < 8) {
        $errors[] = 'Password must be at least 8 characters long';
    }
    
    if (!preg_match('/[A-Z]/', $password)) {
        $errors[] = 'Password must contain at least one uppercase letter';
    }
    
    if (!preg_match('/[a-z]/', $password)) {
        $errors[] = 'Password must contain at least one lowercase letter';
    }
    
    if (!preg_match('/[0-9]/', $password)) {
        $errors[] = 'Password must contain at least one number';
    }
    
    return empty($errors) ? true : $errors;
}
```

#### 4.3.2 Rate Limiting Implementation

**Database-Driven Rate Limiting:**
```php
function checkRateLimit($action, $limit, $window) {
    $db = getDB();
    $ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
    $userId = $_SESSION['user_id'] ?? null;
    
    $identifier = $userId ? "user:{$userId}" : "ip:{$ip}";
    $windowStart = date('Y-m-d H:i:s', time() - $window);
    
    // Count recent attempts
    $attempts = $db->selectOne(
        "SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM rate_limits 
         WHERE identifier = ? AND action = ? AND created_at > ?",
        [$identifier, $action, $windowStart]
    )['count'];
    
    if ($attempts >= $limit) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Record this attempt
    $db->insert('rate_limits', [
        'identifier' => $identifier,
        'action' => $action,
        'created_at' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s')
    ]);
    
    return true;
}
```
